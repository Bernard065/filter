# filter

The filter() function in JavaScript is another higher-order function available for arrays. It's used to create a new array containing elements that satisfy a given condition. The filter() function iterates over each element of the original array and includes only the elements for which the provided function returns true.

Here's the syntax of the filter() function:

```javascript
const newArray = array.filter(callback(currentValue[, index[, array]]) {
  // Your condition here
  // Return true to include the element in the new array
});

```
